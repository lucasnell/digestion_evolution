We used jackknifing to estimate how influential points were to `phylolm` 
and `cor_phylo` model estimates.
We first conducted jackknife replicates (1 per row in the dataset), where, for
replicate $i$, we removed row $i$ from the dataset and re-fit the original model
with the subsetted datset.
This resulted in an $n$ by $p$ matrix of the jackknifed coefficient estimates
($\mathbf{B}$), 
where $n$ is the sample size and $p$ the number of coefficients estimated.
For column $j$ from 1 to $p$, we did the following:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:jackknife}
\begin{split}
    \mathbf{\hat{B}}_j &= \mathbf{B}_j - \mathbf{b}_{(0)j} \\
    \mathbf{\tilde{B}}_j &= \frac{ \mathbf{\hat{B}}_j - \mu_{\mathbf{\hat{B}}_j} }{ 
        \sigma_{\mathbf{\hat{B}}_j} }
\end{split}
\end{equation}

where $\mathbf{B}_j$ refers to column $j$ in $\mathbf{B}$,
$\mu_{\mathbf{\hat{B}}_j}$ and $\sigma_{\mathbf{\hat{B}}_j}$ are the mean and 
standard deviation of $\mathbf{\hat{B}}_j$ respectively,
and $\mathbf{b}_{(0)j}$ is the $j$th item from the initial vector of coefficient 
estimates using the full dataset.
The output $n$ by $p$ matrix, $\mathbf{\tilde{B}}$, presents influence-value
Z-scores (scaled to have a standard deviation of one and mean of zero).
We used the absolute value of these Z-scores for plotting.
